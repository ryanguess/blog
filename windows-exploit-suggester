Easy fix if you're getting the error `xlrd.biffh.XLRDError: Excel xlsx file; not supported` when running [https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester](windows-exploit-suggester).

`python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2022-08-16-mssb.xls --systeminfo wesng/sysinfo.txt`
```
[*] initiating winsploit version 3.3...
[*] database file detected as xls or xlsx based on extension
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "windows-exploit-suggester.py", line 1639, in <module>
    main()
  File "windows-exploit-suggester.py", line 414, in main
    wb = xlrd.open_workbook(ARGS.database)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xlrd/__init__.py", line 170, in open_workbook
    raise XLRDError(FILE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTIONS[file_format]+'; not supported')
xlrd.biffh.XLRDError: Excel xlsx file; not supported
```

1)Uninstall the current version of `python-xlrd` by deleting the directory it's located in. In my case it shows in the error above. 
`rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xlrd`

2) Install version `xlrd 1.2.0` from the PyPi site.
[https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/1.2.0/#files]()

3) Extract
`tar -xvzf xlrd-1.2.0.tar.gz`

4) Install
```
cd xlrd-1.2.0
python2.7 setup.py install
```

Now we're done and windows-exploit-suggest.py should run perfectly.
`python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2022-08-16-mssb.xls --systeminfo wesng/sysinfo.txt`
