## Secnotes@HackTheBox


**Machine Details**

SecNotes is a Windows machine that is running IIS web server on Ports 80 and 8808. The initial foothold is made by an XRSF attack against the webadmin admin, "Tyler", who clicks a link that we craft to change the password to his account. Once the link is clicked, we login to his account and see there are some credentials for an SMB account with a share that we have READ/WRITE privileges. We then upload a shell and netcat to get a reverse shell.
Once we have a reverse shell, browsing to Tyler's desktop exposes a .lnk file linking to bash.exe that is missing, after searching for the missing bash.exe we find it in a different directory, executing it spawns a bash shell with root privileges. Once spawned into the bash shell, reading .bash_history exposes Administrator's credentials which can be used multiple ways. I used psexec.py to spawn a root shell and get the root flag.

# Exploitation 

**Port 80**

We know the admin's username is tyler:

- There is a header when you login telling you to contact tyler@secnotes.htb with any questions.
- Trying to login to user "admin" returns "invalid username", logging in with user "tyler" returns "invalid password"
<img width="1020" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58801175/182289496-ba3d89a4-b0db-47ca-83e7-7794969009d6.png">

Looking deeper into the webapp, the change_pass.php page doesn't ask you to confirm your current password before changing your password. Which could mean it's vulnerable to a CSRF attack.

**Using CSRF to take over tyler's account using change_pass.php**

In order to create a CSRF payload we need to know all the parameters for the request we want to forge.
Capturing the request to change the password to my test account shows there are 3 parameters: `password=asdsad&confirm_password=asdasd&submit=submit`

```
POST /change_pass.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.97
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux aarch64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

Cookie: PHPSESSID=grafdstet4gnivi29gbglt9de0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

password=asdsad&confirm_password=asdasd&submit=submit
```

Now we have the parameters, let's make the payload.
PoC: [http://10.10.10.97/change\_pass.php?password=hacked&confirm\_password=hacked&submit=submit](http://10.10.10.97/change_pass.php?password=hacked&confirm_password=hacked&submit=submit)

This is the link I'll send through the contact form. If Tyler or anybody else clicks it, their password will be changed to "hacked".
Submit the link through the contact form located at http://secnotes.htb/contact.php and wait for Tyler to click it.

I waited about 30 seconds and tried to login to Tyler's account using `tyler:hacked` and it worked.
We now have access to tyler's secure notes.

Opening the "new site" note reveals some credentials and what looks to be an smbshare.

```
\\secnotes.htb\new-site
tyler / 92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&
```



**SMB/Port 445**

Using smbmap to check the privileges with tyler's account
note: using single quotes to wrap the password in allows us to bypass the exclamation mark which bash terminals interpret it as "Not" (like in boolean)

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.97 -u tyler -p '92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&'                2 â¨¯

We have READ/WRITE on new-site and READ on IPC$ shares.

```
There's nothing of interest in there, but we know the new site is running on Port 8808 from browsing to it earlier we saw the default IIS page.
The site running on port 80 is using php, I'll assume port 8808 is also using php. 
Let's test the theory that the new-site is running on port 8808
Upload test.txt and curl it.
```
echo test > test.txt
fg
put test.txt
â””â”€# curl http://10.10.10.97:8808/test.txt
test
```

The theory seems to be true, time to upload a shell.
